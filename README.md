#  Nearest path inside polygon using triangulation 

The triangulate code is copied from GeomAlgLib repository repo

This code implement the simple duck funnel algorithm to search for paths inside a polygon

TODO : 
- Improve triangulation to support holes. (FFI Triangle and use delaunay triangulation)
- Support 3d polygon
- Search for multiple paths in polygons with holes
- Improve Graph search
